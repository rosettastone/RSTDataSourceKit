# RSTDataSourceKit
*Data source objects that keep your view controllers light*

**Still a work in-progress. We'll be pushing a CocoaPod soon.**

## About

We believe in [lighter view controllers](http://www.objc.io/issue-1/) and less boilerplate code. This library aims to address these issues, specifically regarding the data source objects associated with `UITableView` and `UICollectionView`, while maintaing a focus on [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) design principles and unit-testable code.
